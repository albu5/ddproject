# DCT coeffiecients based illumination invariant mean-shift tracking
This directory contains code from Kalyani's work. To run a demo, use mean_shift_trackingexample_dct2.m or msdct_cript.m files. Change the file paths for input and output sequences for appropriate results. Use msdct.m for using the code in VOT-challenge (https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit) framework.
