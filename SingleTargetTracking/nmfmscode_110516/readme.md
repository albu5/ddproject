# NMF based illumination invariant mean-shift tracking
This directory contains code from Gargi Phadke's work. To run a demo, use mean_shift_tracking_nmf170216.m or nmfms_vot_test.m files. Change the file paths for input and output sequences for appropriate results. Use nmfms.m for using the code in VOT-challenge (https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit) framework.
